# Parellel computing coursework

See pdf attached. 


## Usage

```
./main [options] fileName
    options:
        -c            Colours output of arrays
        -d dim        dimension of square array (i.e. for 25 entries, 5x5)    
        -p prec       Will run computation with precision given
        -t num        Will run main computation with "num" many threads.
        -T            Activate timing mode
```
 The program will read the first `dim * dim` entries of this file and take the
 rest as zero.
 
 `prec` is a double value giving the precision (> 0) you want to calculation
 to stop at.

 `num` is the number (>0) of threads (i.e. cores) to use
 
 In timing mode the program will show sequential and parallel implementation
 timings for thread numbers upto that specified.
 
 For example
 
 ```
    $ ./main array2 -T -t 16 -p 1E-6
    Naive iterate:                  0.000040 seconds
    Parallel iterate 1 threads:     0.009880 seconds
    Parallel iterate 2 threads:     0.009270 seconds
    Parallel iterate 3 threads:     0.008920 seconds
    Parallel iterate 4 threads:     0.008920 seconds
    Parallel iterate 5 threads:     0.008200 seconds
    Parallel iterate 6 threads:     0.008760 seconds
    Parallel iterate 7 threads:     0.009780 seconds
    Parallel iterate 8 threads:     0.008780 seconds
    Parallel iterate 9 threads:     0.008740 seconds
    Parallel iterate 10 threads:    0.008510 seconds
    Parallel iterate 11 threads:    0.008510 seconds
    Parallel iterate 12 threads:    0.010450 seconds
    Parallel iterate 13 threads:    0.011230 seconds
    Parallel iterate 14 threads:    0.010090 seconds
    Parallel iterate 15 threads:    0.011050 seconds
    Parallel iterate 16 threads:    0.010850 seconds
 ```
 
 By default:
     * output will not be coloured.
    * dim will be 5
    * prec will be 1E-3
    * num will be 4
    * timing mode will be off

## How to make and run

 1. Compile using `make`.
 2. Run `./main fileName
  
 For example the file `array1` has 25 entries, so on two threads 
 it can be ran as:
 
 ```
    ./main -d 5 -p 1E-3 -t 2 array1
 ```

## How to use

 1. Compile using `make`.
 2. Run `./main dim file
 
 Where `dim` is the dimension of the array (i.e. it is a square array with 
 `dim * dim` entries). `file` is the filename of the file with the entries in.
 
 The program will read the first `dim * dim` entries of this file and take the
 rest as zero.
